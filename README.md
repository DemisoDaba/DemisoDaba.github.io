## Descriptions

This repository contains a version of printf in C programming language, which maintains the main functions of  basic function. It is totally requested by [Alx-Africa School](https://www.alxafrica.com/) and done by [Demiso Daba of Ethiopia](https://github.com/DemisoDaba/) and [Princeeze of Nigeria](https://github.com/Princeeze744/)
We tried to merge all function in *_printf*.

## The order by which we are trying:
* Step-1: Started by creating a char function plus every format of the char function have a specic use.
* Step-2: The created function will skip '%' and go for the other function format tp run.
* Step-3: We also added each and every prototype to *main.h* header.
* Step-4: 
* Step-5: We handled "%c" "%s" "%" "%d" "i" specifiers: .
